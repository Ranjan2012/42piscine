# **C Piscine @ 42 Adelaide**
This repository contains coding developed at 42Adelaide s C bootcamp (also known as Piscine), from 22/nov/2021 to 20/dec/2021.


42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).

# **Skills developed at C Piscine**

## **Hard Skills**
# C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

# Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

# Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
