# **C Piscine @ 42 Adelaide**
This repository contains coding developed at 42Adelaide s C bootcamp (also known as Piscine), from 22/nov/2021 to 20/dec/2021.


42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).
